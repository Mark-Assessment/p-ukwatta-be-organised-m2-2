## TESTING
### Principles of automated and manual testing
Automated testings are performed with according to a script. And also automated testings are executed via test automation frameworks and with other tools and software. Therefore automated testings are faster.

Automated testing allows the developers to test as much as they want without making high costs.Not only giving the benefit of frequent testing, it provides the continuous feedback to the developer to spot the bugs and errors at the beginning. And also it allows the developer to improve the design, code quality, timely launches, reduces the quality, low mainenance.

Manual testings are performed by humans step by steps without a script. And in manual testing, exploratary testings are posible.

### Testing in this application

In this application manual testings have been performed. The reasons for performing manual testings are, 
     * Human observation can be used in this application which can be useful to offer user-friendly system.
     * Automation tests can be time consuming when testing small changes in the codes.
