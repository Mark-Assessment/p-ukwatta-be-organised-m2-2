I am a worker who works in the retail and the care sectors. I learn programming while I am working. Therefore I have a very tight schedule and it is very difficult to find time to study. Finding a study has become more challenging on hectic days due to the physical tiredness of work in the work places. 
I somhow had to achieve my targets in order to reach my dreams. As the first step of achieving my dream, it was realised that my daily routines needed to be more organised. First of all I wrote down my dreams. And then they were broken down in to sub sections. Then those sub-section were divided in tasks that can be achieved in a given time period of time. Following the concepts of " Eating the elephant in bite sizes" and also SMART (S-specific, M-measurable, A-achievable, R-relavent, T-time bound) theory were applied. 
As a result of these needs, BE ORGANISED AND ACHIEVE THE DREAMS web site has been designed. 
I find that it is very important to write your task and give it a deadline. While you are working for these tasks, it is very important to do the task according to a timer which helps you to improve your productivity levels. I somehow managed to work according to the targets along with deadlines and a timer. 
These is the reason behind to develop a todo list with a deadline and a timer.
